# Improvement Suggestions Evaluation Checklist

## High Impact, Low Effort (Priority 1)

### ☑️ 1.1 Add Coverage Reporting

- [x] Review current test coverage situation
- [x] Add coverage configuration to pyproject.toml
- [x] Update test commands in CLAUDE.md
- [x] Test coverage report generation
- [x] **Decision:** ✅ Implement
- [x] **Notes:** Implemented with 67.03% coverage, fail_under=60%. HTML reports
  generated to htmlcov/. Core data classes have 100% coverage, main.py at 78%,
  visualization backends need improvement.

### ☑️ 3.1 Development Scripts in pyproject.toml

- [x] Review current command complexity
- [x] Research uv.scripts support (not available yet)
- [x] Investigate mise.jdx.dev as alternative (comprehensive analysis)
- [x] Evaluate alternatives (Makefile, justfile, shell aliases)
- [x] **Decision:** ⏸️ Defer
- [x] **Notes:** uv doesn't support [tool.uv.scripts] yet. mise is powerful but
  overkill for solo project with stability concerns. Current verbose commands
  acceptable. Consider simple shell aliases or wait for uv.scripts support.

### ☑️ 2.1 Basic Type Annotations for Public APIs

- [x] Identify main public API surfaces
- [x] Add type hints to ProfileData class
- [x] Add type hints to SolverData class
- [x] Add type hints to main CLI functions
- [x] Install type stubs (pandas-stubs, types-PyYAML)
- [x] Test functionality still works
- [ ] Resolve remaining mypy errors (complex YAML parsing)
- [x] **Decision:** ✅ Implement (partially)
- [x] **Notes:** Basic public API types added with **future** annotations. Core
  classes (ProfileData, SolverData, main functions) have type hints. Some complex
  internal parsing logic still has mypy errors but functionality preserved. Good
  foundation for future type safety improvements.

## Medium Impact, Medium Effort (Priority 2)

### ☑️ 4.2 Logging Infrastructure

- [x] Evaluate current debugging/error reporting
- [x] Design logging strategy (levels, formats)
- [x] Add logging setup to main.py
- [x] Add --verbose flag to CLI
- [x] Test logging in different scenarios
- [x] **Decision:** ✅ Implement
- [x] **Notes:** Comprehensive logging infrastructure implemented with WARNING
  (default), INFO (--verbose), DEBUG (--debug) levels. Console output to stderr,
  optional file logging with --log-file. Main entry points, backend selection,
  and error handling all have appropriate log messages. Maintains backward
  compatibility with existing print statements for user output.

### ☑️ 4.1 Legacy Code Deprecation Plan

- [x] Analyze usage of prof.py vs newer classes
- [x] Identify breaking vs non-breaking changes
- [x] Create migration timeline
- [ ] Add deprecation warnings where appropriate
- [ ] Update documentation to prefer new APIs
- [x] **Decision:** ⏸️ Defer
- [x] **Notes:** Analysis shows prof.Pdata is still heavily used as base class
  for all three backends (tikz.py, matplotlib.py, bokeh.py) and for raw/table
  CLI modes. ProfileData is newer but serves different purpose (pure data
  processing vs full rendering pipeline). Migration would require significant
  backend refactoring with breaking changes. Recommend: keep both classes,
  document prof.Pdata as internal API, promote ProfileData for direct usage.
  Defer major deprecation until v2.0.

### ☑️ 5.1 Enhanced Docstrings with Examples

- [x] Audit current docstring coverage
- [x] Add examples to main classes (ProfileData, SolverData)
- [x] Add examples to key functions (main CLI functions)
- [x] Add examples to backend plot() methods (matplotlib, bokeh, tikz)
- [x] Test examples with doctest (30 tests passing)
- [x] Update documentation generation
- [x] **Decision:** ✅ Implement
- [x] **Notes:** Comprehensive docstring enhancement completed with working doctest
  examples. Added detailed documentation for ProfileData, SolverData, main CLI
  functions, and all three backend plot() methods. Examples use proper code
  blocks for complex cases and working doctests for simple cases. All doctests
  pass (30/30 in core modules). Backend examples use non-executable code blocks
  to avoid file dependency issues. Significant improvement in API documentation
  quality and developer experience.

## Implementation Strategy for Next Cycle

### Current Status Summary

**Completed (5/13 items):**

- ✅ Coverage Reporting (1.1) - 67.03% coverage with HTML reports
- ✅ Type Annotations (2.1) - Basic public API types, TypedDict for CLI args
- ✅ Logging Infrastructure (4.2) - Comprehensive logging with --verbose/--debug
- ✅ Enhanced Docstrings (5.1) - Comprehensive examples, 30 passing doctests
- ⏸️ Development Scripts (3.1) - Deferred until uv.scripts support
- ⏸️ Legacy Code Deprecation (4.1) - Deferred to v2.0 due to complexity

### Recommended Next Target: Configuration File Support (5.2)

**Priority:** High Impact, High Effort
**Rationale:**

- User-facing feature that improves CLI usability and workflow
- Enables reproducible configurations for batch processing
- Professional tool feature that adds significant value
- Complements completed logging and documentation improvements
- Foundation for advanced features like project templates

### Alternative Targets

1. **Comprehensive Type Annotations (2.1)** - High impact but requires mypy
   infrastructure setup
2. **Configuration File Support (5.2)** - User-facing feature, good for CLI
   maturity

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate:** Consider Configuration File Support (5.2) or Comprehensive Type
   Annotations (2.1) as next major improvement
2. **Future cycles:** Property-based testing, security scanning, or dependency
   automation when ready for advanced features
3. **Long-term:** Revisit deferred items (Development Scripts when uv.scripts
   available, Legacy Deprecation for v2.0)
4. Update this checklist as evaluations complete

## Summary

The Enhanced Docstrings improvement (5.1) has been successfully completed,
bringing the total completed improvements to 5 out of 13. The project now has:

- Comprehensive API documentation with working examples
- Strong test coverage with automated reporting
- Professional logging infrastructure
- Basic type safety for public APIs
- High-quality documentation suitable for open source contribution

The next logical step would be Configuration File Support (5.2) to add user-facing
workflow improvements, or Comprehensive Type Annotations (2.1) to build on the
existing type foundation.
