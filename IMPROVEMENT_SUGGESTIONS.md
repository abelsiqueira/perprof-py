# Improvement Suggestions for perprof-py Solo Development

## **1. Test Coverage and Quality Improvements**

### **1.1 Add Coverage Reporting**

```toml
# pyproject.toml addition
[tool.coverage.run]
source = ["perprof"]
omit = ["*/tests/*", "*/examples/*"]

[tool.coverage.report]
exclude_lines = ["pragma: no cover", "def __repr__", "raise AssertionError"]
show_missing = true
fail_under = 80
```

**Why this is good:**

- Shows exactly which code paths aren't tested
- Helps identify risky areas during refactoring
- Provides confidence metric for releases

**Pros:** Visual feedback, objective quality metric, IDE integration
**Cons:** Can become obsessive metric gaming, setup overhead
**Alternative:** Use `pytest-cov` with simpler configuration or skip for small projects

---

### **1.2 Add Property-Based Testing**

```python
# For testing ProfileData with hypothesis
from hypothesis import given, strategies as st

@given(st.lists(st.floats(min_value=0.01, max_value=100), min_size=1))
def test_profile_data_invariants(times):
    # Test that profile properties hold for any valid input
```

**Why this is good:** Catches edge cases you wouldn't think to test manually
**Pros:** Finds bugs in corner cases, documents implicit assumptions
**Cons:** Learning curve, can be overkill for simple functions
**Alternative:** Focus on boundary testing with regular unit tests

---

## **2. Type Safety and IDE Experience**

### **2.1 Comprehensive Type Annotations**

```python
# Example for profile_data.py
from typing import Dict, List, Optional, Union, Protocol
from pathlib import Path

class ProfileData:
    def __init__(
        self,
        solvers: List[SolverData],
        tau: float = 2.0,
        setup: Optional[Dict[str, Any]] = None
    ) -> None: ...
```

**Why this is good:**

- Better IDE autocomplete and error detection
- Self-documenting code
- Catches type-related bugs before runtime

**Pros:** Better development experience, catches bugs early, improves refactoring safety
**Cons:** Initial time investment, can be verbose
**Alternative:** Use `mypy --strict` incrementally or focus on public APIs only

---

### **2.2 Runtime Type Checking with Pydantic**

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel, validator

class SolverConfig(BaseModel):
    name: str
    timeout: float = 300.0

    @validator('timeout')
    def timeout_must_be_positive(cls, v):
        if v <= 0:
            raise ValueError('timeout must be positive')
        return v
```

**Why this is good:** Validates input data at runtime, especially useful for CLI tools
**Pros:** Catches configuration errors early, automatic validation
**Cons:** Additional dependency, runtime overhead
**Alternative:** Simple assertion checks or manual validation

---

## **3. Development Workflow Enhancements**

### **3.1 Add Development Scripts**

```toml
# pyproject.toml
[tool.uv.scripts]
test = "pytest -v --cov=perprof --cov-report=html --cov-report=term"
test-fast = "pytest -x -v"
lint = "pre-commit run --all-files"
check = ["lint", "test"]
demo = "perprof --bokeh --demo"
docs-serve = "mkdocs serve"
```

**Why this is good:**

- Consistent commands across environments
- Reduces cognitive load remembering complex commands
- Easy for new contributors

**Pros:** Standardized workflow, documentation through naming
**Cons:** Another place to maintain commands
**Alternative:** Use Makefile or shell scripts

---

### **3.2 Add Performance Benchmarking**

```python
# Simple benchmark script
import time
import cProfile
from perprof.profile_data import ProfileData

def benchmark_profile_generation():
    # Time critical operations
    start = time.time()
    # ... your operations
    end = time.time()
    print(f"Operation took {end - start:.2f}s")
```

**Why this is good:** Catches performance regressions early, especially important for CLI tools
**Pros:** Objective performance metrics, helps with optimization
**Cons:** Setup and maintenance overhead
**Alternative:** Use existing tools like `pytest-benchmark` or manual timing

---

## **4. Code Organization and Maintainability**

### **4.1 Consolidate Legacy Code**

Create a migration plan to gradually deprecate `prof.py`:

```python
# Add deprecation warnings
import warnings

def deprecated_function():
    warnings.warn(
        "This function is deprecated, use ProfileData instead",
        DeprecationWarning,
        stacklevel=2
    )
```

**Why this is good:**

- Reduces maintenance burden
- Clearer codebase for future you
- Easier to understand for contributors

**Pros:** Simpler architecture, less code to maintain
**Cons:** Breaking changes for users, migration effort
**Alternative:** Keep both but document the preferred approach

---

### **4.2 Add Logging Infrastructure**

```python
import logging
import sys

def setup_logging(verbose: bool = False) -> None:
    level = logging.DEBUG if verbose else logging.INFO
    logging.basicConfig(
        level=level,
        format='%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s',
        stream=sys.stderr
    )
```

**Why this is good:**

- Better debugging for you and users
- Professional CLI experience
- Easier troubleshooting

**Pros:** Better debugging, professional feel, configurable verbosity
**Cons:** Code noise, potential performance impact
**Alternative:** Use `print()` statements or structured logging with `structlog`

---

## **5. Documentation and User Experience**

### **5.1 Add Usage Examples in Code**

```python
class ProfileData:
    """Performance profile data processor.

    Examples:
        >>> from perprof import ProfileData, SolverData
        >>> solver1 = SolverData("solver1", {"prob1": 1.2, "prob2": 2.3})
        >>> solver2 = SolverData("solver2", {"prob1": 1.5, "prob2": 1.8})
        >>> profile = ProfileData([solver1, solver2])
        >>> profile.plot_matplotlib("output.png")
    """
```

**Why this is good:**

- Examples are always up-to-date with code
- Better IDE experience
- Easier to understand API

**Pros:** Always current examples, IDE integration, testable with doctest
**Cons:** More verbose docstrings
**Alternative:** Separate example files or notebooks

---

### **5.2 Add Configuration File Support**

```python
# perprof.toml configuration file support
[perprof]
tau = 2.0
backend = "matplotlib"
output_format = "pdf"

[perprof.matplotlib]
figure_size = [8, 6]
dpi = 300
```

**Why this is good:**

- Repeatable configurations
- Easier for batch processing
- Professional tool experience

**Pros:** Reproducible results, less CLI complexity
**Cons:** Another file format to support
**Alternative:** Environment variables or command-line only

---

## **6. Deployment and Distribution**

### **6.1 Add Security Scanning**

```yaml
# .github/workflows/security.yml
- name: Run Bandit Security Scan
  run: uv run bandit -r perprof/
- name: Run Safety Check
  run: uv run safety check
```

**Why this is good:**

- Catches potential security issues
- Important for packages that others install
- Professional development practice

**Pros:** Automated security checking, peace of mind
**Cons:** Another CI step, potential false positives
**Alternative:** Manual security reviews or third-party scanning services

---

### **6.2 Add Dependency Update Automation**

```yaml
# .github/dependabot.yml
version: 2
updates:
  - package-ecosystem: "pip"
    directory: "/"
    schedule:
      interval: "weekly"
```

**Why this is good:**

- Keeps dependencies current automatically
- Reduces security vulnerabilities
- Less manual maintenance

**Pros:** Automated maintenance, security updates
**Cons:** Potential breaking changes, PR noise
**Alternative:** Manual updates with `uv lock --upgrade`
