\maketitle

Benchmarking optimization packages are very important in optimization field, not
only because it is one of the way to compare packages, but also to uncover
deficiencies that could be overlooked. During benchmarking, one can obtain
several informations, like CPU time, number of functions evaluations, number of
iterations and so on. These informations, if presented as tables, can be
difficult to be analyzed, due, for instance, to large amount of data. Therefore,
researchers started testing tools to better process and understand this data.
One of the most widespread ways to do so is using Performance Profile graphics
proposed by \citeauthor{Dolan2001}.

In this context, we implemented a free software that makes Performance Profile
using data provided by user in a friendly manner. This software produces
graphics in PDF using LaTeX with PGF/TikZ\nocite{TikZ} and
pgfplots\nocite{pgfplots} packages, in PNG using matplotlib\nocite{Hunter:2007}
and can also be easily extended to use with other plot library. The software is
implemented in Python3 with support for internationalization and is available on
\url{https://github.com/abelsiqueira/perprof-py}.
